# constituency-to-nuts2
This repo contains geographic region conversion tables. If you find anything incorrect, please make an issue.

This table was created to link UK parliamentary constituencies in England and Wales to NUTS2 (2012) regions. The parliamentary constituencies contain constituencies present from 2005 to 2018. Note that non-alphabetic characters have been stripped.

Note: Some areas slightly overlap; the NUTS region containing most of the geographic area of the constituency was selected.
